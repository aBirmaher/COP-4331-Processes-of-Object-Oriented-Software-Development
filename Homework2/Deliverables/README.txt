Welcome to the Student Sorter!
by Alan Birmaher

This project is in a zip file, which contains an Eclipse project, in which the program is contained. In order to import the file into 
Eclipse, use the import existing project functionality.

The purpose of this program is to read in a file broken down into classes in which are students. The user then has the option to sort 
using various criteria for the top three students in a specific class with regards to those sort parameters.

Verify that you have a file to read in named "input.txt" stored in the main project directory or you will receive an error and the program 
will exit.

The program functions as follows:

Step 1) Choose a class of students to sort, you will be given a list with classes and their corresponding numerical values. You will then 
be prompted for your selection, which you type in using the keyboard, and then press enter.

Step 2) Next you will be given options for what to sort by. Again you will have corresponding numerical values for each choice. You will 
enter your choice using the keyboard when prompted and then press enter.

Step 3) You will lastly have the option of having your results printed to the console or to a file, "out.txt", which will be created in the same 
location in which your input file resides. The selection process will be like the previous 2, with the option of inputting 1 or 2 via the keyboard 
respectively followed by enter.

Step 4) If you chose to print to the console that is where you will see the results of your sort and if you chose to the file you will find the 
results in the file mentioned in step 3. The program will then terminate after displaying a "Successful Sort" message.
